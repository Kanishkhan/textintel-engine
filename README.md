🧠 TextIntel: Intelligent Text Prediction & Analysis Engine
TextIntel is an advanced word-processing engine designed to analyze, predict, and relate words using classic Data Structures and Algorithms. It combines multiple intelligent components like Trie-based autocomplete, bigram prediction, Red-Black Tree search, and graph-based word relationships to provide rich linguistic insights and fast text predictions.

📌 Key Features:
🔤 Auto-Completion using Trie Data Structure

📊 Next Word Prediction using Bigram Frequency Model

🌳 Efficient Word Storage & Search via Red-Black Tree

🔗 Word Relationship Mapping through Directed Graphs (using NetworkX)

📈 Top Word Frequency Tracking with Python’s Counter

💬 Interactive CLI Chat Interface for demo and testing

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used:
Language: Python 3

Libraries: collections, networkx

Data Structures: Trie, Red-Black Tree, Graphs, Counters

🎓 Academic Context:
This project was developed as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) coursework in the 3rd semester of my undergraduate studies. The goal was to apply core DSA concepts to solve a real-world problem—in this case, building an intelligent word prediction engine.
